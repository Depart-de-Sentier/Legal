# DdS Board Meeting

Tomas, Chris, Karin; May 3, 2022; Online

## Budget update

* Current balance is 1789
* Expected at end of May is 5800
* Current liabilities are 1250 to end of year

We don't expect to lose money on Brightcon

We could face up to 2000 liability for the autumn course (though the chances here are small)

## Expenses

* ~300 to Chris for server for the next three months
* ~300 allocated for additional software development prizes

## Expanding our capabilities

Industry outreach: Input from Karin

Board membership

General membership - take fees from conference proposal and open membership?

Honorary membership?

## Strategic plan

Very important for communication and prioritization

Chris sees the following needs for Brightway:

* try.brightway.dev up and running with containers
* Scripts to add/remove users (plus documentation)
* Documentation for 2.5 with new template
* bw2data work on moving completely away from JSON/pickle files for metadata
* bw2regional needs to be able to run "headless", i.e. without access to bw2data

In the medium term:

* Clean split between bw2io and bw2data using ILCD format (or other?)
* Only use best practices for development/testing
* No dependency on projects
* Multiple core contributors!!!

## Contract with LIST

Open questions (email "Brightcon 2022 status report" from April 15):

·       Page 1: What is the exact legal status of DdS?

·       Page 1, about the division of tasks between DdS and LIST: the mention ”search for a scientific journal interested in publishing a special issue, following the organisation of the Conference” (in yellow):
Thank you to confirm if it is applicable for this event.

·       Page 3 – Article 5 about the registration fee:
In order to balance the budget, we would propose registration fee for the “training and the conference” and for the conference only.  The 2 possibilities include the workshop.
You will see that we added an estimated amount for the memberships to DdS (point 5.2) in the total cost of the event.  This estimation for the memberships is in the incomes too (see provisional budget page 7). 
About the registration fee, is it validated on your side?  Do you want to propose special registration fee for students?  If yes, we will have to find more incomes with the sponsors for example.

·       Page 3 – Article 5.7 and 5.8 : It clarifies the situation between DdS and LIST in case of a net surplus or a deficit after the establishment of the final financial statement.

·       Page 4 – Article 6 about the Data Protection: this article is updated. Sara asked you to update your DPO’s contact details in Annex 2.

·       Page 7 – Provisional budget with an estimated amount for the DdS memberships.

Regarding the registration forms, we will give you different links in order to publish them on the website (with a link or a button for example):

·       The first one for the authors with specific authorisation requests regarding the review and the publication of the abstract;

·       The second one for the other attendees.

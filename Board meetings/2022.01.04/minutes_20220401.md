# DdS Board Meeting

Tomas, Chris, Karin; April 1st, 2022; Online

## Validate sponsorship plans

* What do sponsors get - e.g. big banner, free spot; and for how much money do they get it
* Aim for a sponsor for 5 days = EUR 1000.-
* Should the conference day be free?
* Extra money left: Keep it, pay it to LIST for catering, use it for DdS? 
* Money needed: 
	** Room/catering
	** Goodie: e.g. air monitoring device to build oneself; last year 30 T-Shirts (there were more people on-site, but there was a cut-off)
* Attendees: Last year there were 30 with Coronva restrictions, this year could be 100
* Chris gave an online course, 8 people from South Korea, EUR 2000.-
* 500.- allocated to prices
* 4000.- CHF from DdS for the conference if need be
* Fee for 2 training days, free conf and hackathon
* 5k from LIST for catering. If that's not enough, use training fee to cover
* Buffet lunch: 22EUR/person lunch, 15  EUR/p coffee break = 37EUR/person
* LIST budget is maybe up to 6k


## Fix dates (september) and format (2 Training days, 1 conf day, 2 hackathon days)

* Conference attendees: Half beginners, half medium advanced. Only few people whom we know work in-depth. 
* Hackathon: Building community, not productive
* Day1/2 regular training
* Day 3 and 4 morning: conference, interactive
* Day 4 afternoon and day 5: hackathon
* Chris can volunteer to do the teaching session (2 days). Maybe have a beginners and an advanced track
* Hybrid? Physical? Streaming on youtube monitored by someone.
Feedback from last time:
* Case studies = demo contest
* Longer keynotes = ask someone for a keynote. Chris has some ideas
* Working with mentors = when signing in for the conference, tick if you want to be a mentor or a mentee

## draft the demo(s) + prize schedule and call

* Demo contest thing: Few weeks/days before the conference, we call out a demo contest. Doesn't need to be a GUI, just demonstrating what you do in BW2. They could then give the demo during the conference, which would showcase application cases and motivate beginners. These demos could also be brought into the hackathon
* Chris will write this up.

## Action items, open issues
* Chris: Initial schedule, detailed budget
* Karin: follow-up mentoring idea
* Karin&Chris: Opening the bank account
* All: 
 ** Decision on number of people and fees to charge both in the teaching session and during the conference
 ** Social event on Saturday --> budget?

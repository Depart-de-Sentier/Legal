## Sign Partnership Agreement

* HTVA: hors tax (tout tax compris is the opposite)
* Trainings = coffee breaks included, lunch bring your own

* GDPR --> storing personal data only allow for people inside EEA (European Economic Area). During registration (check-in), allow DdS to keep the contact data for next year/membership etc.
* DPO (Data protection officers)


## Agreement on registration fees amounts
Agreeing on the fees requires a good overview of the budget. The choices are more or less the following:
a) We set fees right now, that cover all expenses, with provisional number of participants we expect, without caring about how much we get from sponsors
b) We set fees considering that we will get at least x â‚¬ of sponsorship
* Who gets free registration
* Sponsorship
*  End up with >10%, rather 20% over to have some sense of security. E.g. more expensive food.
